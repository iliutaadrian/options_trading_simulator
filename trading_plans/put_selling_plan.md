# Put Selling Trading Plan

## Overview
A systematic approach to selling puts for income, focusing on high-probability trades with defined risk parameters. This plan utilizes technical analysis (Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages), volatility metrics (IV Rank), and options Greeks to identify optimal selling opportunities.

## Key Objectives
- Sell puts when they touch lower Bollinger Bands with oversold RSI
- Collect premium while monitoring VIX and interest rate changes
- Focus on optimal Greeks for maximum time decay

## Technical Setup

### 1. Bollinger Bands + RSI Strategy
- **Sell puts when price touches lower Bollinger Band**: Oversold condition
- **RSI < 30**: Confirms oversold condition
- **Wait for bounce confirmation**: Price moving away from lower band

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- **High VIX correlation**: Sell puts during elevated fear (high volatility)
- **Low TNX (Treasury rates)**: Lower cost of carry, more attractive
- **VIX > 20**: Generally better for selling premium

### 3. Support/Resistance
- **Strike price is below key support levels**: Reduces assignment risk
- **Minimum $2+ cushion from current price to strike**: Buffer for stock movement

## Greeks Management

### Key Greeks to Monitor
- **Theta (Time Decay)**: Positive, measure daily decay rate
- **Gamma**: Negative, understand how delta changes with price moves
- **Vega**: Negative, sensitive to volatility decreases
- **ROR (Return on Risk)**: Target >2% for short puts

## Option Selection Rules

### 1. Strike Selection
- **Target 0.30 delta or lower**: 70% probability of expiring worthless
- **Strike price at or below recent support**: If assigned, favorable entry point
- **Avoid strikes near earnings/announcements**: Volatility events

### 2. Expiration Timing
- **30 days until expiration**: Optimal theta decay period
- **Avoid FOMC meetings and major events**: Event risk management
- **High VIX environment**: Better selling conditions

## Risk Management

### 1. Position Sizing
- **Max 1-2% of account per trade**: Limit individual risk
- **Total short put exposure < 20%**: Overall portfolio risk management
- **No more than 5-7 positions**: Maintain focus and manageability

### 2. Assignment Management
- **If assigned, hold for 3-6 months**: Let volatility mean-revert
- **Have plan B for assignment**: Dividend yield or upside potential
- **Roll up if assigned and in the money**: Collect additional premium

### 3. Loss Management
- **Roll if loss reaches 21% of max profit**: Cut losses early
- **Close at 50% profit**: Take profits on strong moves
- **Never add to losing positions**: Avoid averaging down
